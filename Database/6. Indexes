Indexes
-> An index is a data structure used by databases to speed up data retrieval. 
-> Instead of scanning every row in a table, the database uses the index to quickly 
locate where the required data lives—similar to a table of contents in a book.

-> An index stores the indexed column value along with a pointer to the actual row.

Indexes improve read performance but come with trade-offs:
	• More storage usage
	• Slower writes, because indexes must also be updated on insert, update, or delete

-> Indexes can be built on one or more columns, enabling fast lookups, sorting, and 
filtering without duplicating data. This is especially useful for large datasets.

Dense Index
A dense index has an index entry for every row in the table.
	• Fast lookups (direct binary search)
	• No ordering requirement on data
	• Higher memory usage
	• Slower writes due to frequent index updates

Used when read performance is critical.

Sparse Index
A sparse index has entries for only some rows (typically one per data block or range).
	• Lower memory usage
	• Faster writes
	• Slightly slower reads (binary search + scan)
	• Works best with ordered data

Used when write performance and storage efficiency matter more.
