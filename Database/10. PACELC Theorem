PACELC Theorem

The PACELC theorem is an extension of the CAP theorem. 
The CAP theorem states that in the case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed system, 
one has to choose between Availability (A) and Consistency (C).

PACELC extends the CAP theorem by introducing latency (L) as an additional attribute of a 
distributed system. 

-> If there is a Partition (P), a system must choose between Availability (A) and 
Consistency (C); Else (E), when there is no partition, the system must choose between 
Latency (L) and Consistency (C).

The PACELC theorem was first described by Daniel J. Abadi.

	• PAC → behavior during failures
	• ELC → behavior during normal operation

Even when the system is healthy, distributed databases still make a trade-off between 
low latency and strong consistency.

PACELC theorem was developed to address a key limitation of the CAP theorem as 
it makes no provision for performance or latency.

For example, according to the CAP theorem, a database can be considered available 
if a query returns a response after 30 days. 
Obviously, such latency would be unacceptable for any real-world application.

The PACELC theorem says distributed systems always make trade-offs:
	• During partitions: Consistency vs Availability
	• Without partitions: Consistency vs Latency
