Databases and DBMS
-> A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically. 
-> It is managed using a Database Management System (DBMS), which acts as an interface between 
the data and users or applications. 
-> The DBMS enables creating, reading, updating, and managing data, while also handling 
administrative tasks like performance tuning, monitoring, security, backup, and recovery. 
-> Together, the data, DBMS, and related applications form a database system.


Components
1. Schema
A schema defines the structure of data and what types of values are allowed, 
and it may be strictly enforced, loosely enforced, or absent. 

2. Table
A table stores data in a structured format similar to a spreadsheet, consisting of columns and rows. 

3. Columns
A column contains a set of data values of a particular type, one value for each row of the database. 
A column may contain text values, numbers, enums, timestamps, etc.

4. Rows
Data in a table is recorded in rows. There can be thousands or millions of rows in a table 
having any particular information.


Types of databases
1. SQL
2. NoSQL
    1. Document
    2. Key - Value 
    3. Graph
    4. Timeseries
    5. Wide column
    6. Multi-model


Challenges
	• Handling rapidly growing data volumes from multiple sources
	• Ensuring strong data security while keeping data accessible
	• Supporting real-time data access for business decisions
	• Managing increasing database and infrastructure complexity
	• Scaling efficiently without accurately predicting future capacity
	• Meeting data residency, sovereignty, and low-latency requirements
