ACID and BASE consistency models

ACID
-> ACID is a set of properties that ensure reliable and correct transaction processing 
in relational databases. 
-> These properties guarantee data integrity even in the presence of failures, concurrency, 
or crashes.

1. Atomicity:
A transaction is treated as a single unit—either all operations succeed or none do. 
If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

2. Consistency:
A transaction takes the database from one valid state to another, 
ensuring all rules, constraints, and relationships remain intact.

3. Isolation:
Multiple transactions can run at the same time without interfering with each other. 
The database ensures transactions behave as if they were executed sequentially.

4. Durability:
Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently stored and 
will survive system crashes or failures.

ACID properties ensure that database transactions are all-or-nothing, valid, independent, 
and permanent, providing strong data correctness and reliability in relational databases.


BASE
-> BASE is a consistency model commonly used by NoSQL databases to achieve high scalability 
and availability in distributed systems. 
-> As data volume and availability requirements grow, systems shift logic away 
from the database and relax strict consistency guarantees to remain highly available and 
resilient.
-> Unlike ACID, which enforces strong transactional consistency, BASE allows 
temporary inconsistency to gain better scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.

1. Basically Available:
The system remains operational and responds to requests most of the time, even during failures.

2. Soft State:
The system state may change over time, and replicas do not need to be immediately consistent 
with each other.

3. Eventual Consistency:
Data may be inconsistent temporarily, but eventually all replicas converge to the same 
correct state.

BASE favors availability and scalability over strict consistency, 
allowing temporary inconsistencies with the guarantee that the system will eventually 
become consistent—making it ideal for large-scale, distributed NoSQL systems.


ACID vs BASE Trade-offs
There is no universally correct choice between ACID and BASE —
each consistency model is designed for different application needs. 
The decision should be based on system requirements, such as consistency, availability, 
scalability, and developer complexity.

BASE systems trade strict consistency for scalability and availability, 
which means developers must carefully handle data consistency at the application level 
and fully understand the database’s eventual consistency behavior. 
This added responsibility can increase system complexity and the risk of data anomalies.

ACID databases simplify application design by guaranteeing strong consistency and reliability. 
They are best suited for use cases where data correctness is critical, 
such as financial systems, where the simplicity and safety of ACID transactions 
outweigh scalability trade-offs.
