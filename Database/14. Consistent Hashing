Consistent Hashing

Consistent hashing is a technique used to distribute data across a dynamic set of nodes 
(servers/shards) while minimizing data movement when nodes are added or removed.

Instead of hashing data directly to a fixed number of servers, 
both data keys and servers are mapped onto a logical hash ring. 
Each data item is assigned to the next server clockwise on the ring. 
When a server joins or leaves, only the data mapped to that server is remapped, 
not the entire dataset.

To improve load balance, virtual nodes (vnodes) are used—each physical server is 
represented multiple times on the ring. 
This ensures more even data distribution and smoother scaling.

Why it matters:
Traditional hashing requires rehashing most data when the number of servers changes. 
Consistent hashing avoids this, making it ideal for distributed caches, databases, and 
sharded systems.


Advantages
1. Makes rapid scaling up and down more predictable.
2. Facilitates partitioning and replication across nodes.
3. Enables scalability and availability.
4. Reduces hotspots.

Disadvantages
1. Increases complexity.
2. Cascading failures.
3. Load distribution can still be uneven.
4. Key management can be expensive when nodes transiently fail.
