SQL 
-> A SQL (or relational) database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships 
between them. 
-> These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. 
-> Tables are used to hold information about the objects to be represented in the database. 
-> Each column in a table holds a certain kind of data and a field stores the actual value of an attribute. 
-> The rows in the table represent a collection of related values of one object or entity.

-> Each row in a table could be marked with a unique identifier called a primary key, 
and rows among multiple tables can be made related using foreign keys. 
-> SQL databases usually follow the ACID consistency model.


A materialized view stores pre-computed query results to provide much faster reads for complex or 
frequently used queries, improving performance, reducing network load, and supporting replication 
or reporting use cases.


N+1 query problem
The N+1 query problem happens when the data access layer executes N additional SQL statements 
to fetch the same data that could have been retrieved when executing the primary SQL query. 
The larger the value of N, the more queries will be executed, the larger the performance impact.

This is commonly seen in GraphQL and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools and 
can be addressed by optimizing the SQL query or using a dataloader that batches 
consecutive requests and makes a single data request under the hood.


Advantages
1. Simple and accurate
2. Accessibility
3. Data consistency
4. Flexibility

Disadvantages
1. Expensive to maintain
2. Difficult schema evolution
3. Performance hits (join, denormalization, etc.)
4. Difficult to scale due to poor horizontal scalability


Examples
1. PostgreSQL
2. MySQL
3. MariaDB
