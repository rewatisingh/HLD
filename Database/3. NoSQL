NoSQL
-> NoSQL databases are schema-flexible, non-relational data stores designed for 
scalability and availability, commonly following the 
BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) consistency model instead of 
strict ACID guarantees.

Types
1. Document
-> A document database (also known as a document-oriented database or a document store) 
is a database that stores information in documents. 
-> They are general-purpose databases that serve a variety of use cases for both 
transactional and analytical applications.

Advantages
1. Intuitive and flexible
2. Easy horizontal scaling
3. Schemaless

Disadvantages
1. Schemaless
2. Non-relational

Examples
1. MongoDB
2. Amazon DocumentDB
3. CouchDB

2. Key-value
-> One of the simplest types of NoSQL databases, key-value databases save data as a group of 
key-value pairs made up of two data items each. 
-> They're also sometimes referred to as a key-value store.

Advantages
1. Simple and performant
2. Highly scalable for high volumes of traffic
3. Session management
4. Optimized lookups

Disadvantages
1. Basic CRUD
2. Values can't be filtered
3. Lacks indexing and scanning capabilities
4. Not optimized for complex queries

Examples
1. Redis
2. Memcached
3. Amazon DynamoDB
4. Aerospike

3. Graph
-> A graph database is a NoSQL database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, 
edges, and properties to represent and store data instead of tables or documents.
-> The graph relates the data items in the store to a collection of nodes and edges, 
the edges representing the relationships between the nodes. 
-> The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly and, 
in many cases, retrieved with one operation.

Advantages
1. Query speed
2. Agile and flexible
3. Explicit data representation

Disadvantages
1. Complex
2. No standardized query language

Use cases
1. Fraud detection
2. Recommendation engines
3. Social networks
4. Network mapping

Examples
1. Neo4j
2. ArangoDB
3. Amazon Neptune
4. JanusGraph

4. Time series
-> A time-series database is a database optimized for time-stamped, or time series, data.

Advantages
1. Fast insertion and retrieval
2. Efficient data storage

Use cases
1. IoT data
2. Metrics analysis
3. Application monitoring
4. Understand financial trends

Examples
1. InfluxDB
2. Apache Druid

5. Wide column
-> Wide column databases, also known as wide column stores, are schema-agnostic.
-> Data is stored in column families, rather than in rows and columns.

Advantages
1. Highly scalable, can handle petabytes of data
2. Ideal for real-time big data applications

Disadvantages
1. Expensive
2. Increased write time

Use cases
1. Business analytics
2. Attribute-based data storage

Examples
1. BigTable
2. Apache Cassandra
3. ScyllaDB

6. Multi-model
-> Multi-model databases combine different database models 
(i.e. relational, graph, key-value, document, etc.) into a single, integrated backend. 
-> This means they can accommodate various data types, indexes, queries, and store data in more 
than one model.

Advantages
1. Flexibility
2. Suitable for complex projects
3. Data consistent

Disadvantages
1. Complex
2. Less mature

Examples
1. ArangoDB
2. Azure Cosmos DB
3. Couchbase
