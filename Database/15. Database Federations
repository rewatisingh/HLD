Database Federation

Database Federation (also called functional partitioning) is an approach where data is 
split across multiple independent databases by function, but presented to users as one 
logical database. Each database continues to operate autonomously, while a 
federated schema defines how shared data is exposed and accessed across the system.

A federated database provides a unified view over multiple data sources, 
which may include different databases and even structured or unstructured data. 
The key idea is integration without consolidation—data stays where it is, 
but can be queried as if it were in one place.

Key Characteristics
	• Transparency: Users don’t need to know where the data physically resides.
	• Heterogeneity: Supports different DBMSs, data models, hardware, and protocols.
	• Extensibility: New data sources can be added easily as business needs evolve.
	• Autonomy: Existing databases remain unchanged and independently managed.
	• Data Integration: Combines data from multiple systems into a cohesive view.


Advantages
	• Flexible data sharing across systems
	• Preserves autonomy of individual databases
	• Unified access to heterogeneous data
	• Loose coupling with legacy systems

Disadvantages
	• Increased system complexity and hardware overhead
	• Cross-database joins are difficult and expensive
	• Dependence on independently managed data sources
	• Performance and scalability challenges
