High Level Differences

1. Storage
SQL: Stores data in tables, where each row represents an entity and each column represents a 
data point about that entity.

NoSQL: They have different data storage models such as key-value, graph, document, etc.

2. Schema
SQL: Each record conforms to a fixed schema, meaning the columns must be decided and 
chosen before data entry and each row must have data for each column. 
The schema can be altered later, but it involves modifying the database using migrations.

NoSQL: Schemas are dynamic. Fields can be added on the fly, and each record (or equivalent) 
doesn't have to contain data for each field.

3. Querying
SQL: Use SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating the data, 
which is very powerful.

NoSQL: Queries are focused on a collection of documents. 
Different databases have different syntax for querying.

4. Scalability
SQL: Vertically scalable, which can get very expensive. It is possible to scale a relational database 
across multiple servers, but this is a challenging and time-consuming process.

NoSQL: Horizontally scalable, meaning we can add more servers easily to our NoSQL database 
infrastructure to handle large traffic. 

5. Reliability
SQL: Better because follows ACID properties

NoSQL: Sacrifice ACID compliance for performance and scalability.


Reasons For SQL
1. Structured data with strict schema
2. Relational data
3. Need for complex joins
4. Transactions
5. Lookups by index are very fast


Reasons For NoSQL
1. Dynamic or flexible schema
2. Non-relational data
3. No need for complex joins
4. Very data-intensive workload
5. Very high throughput for IOPS
