Clustering
-> A computer cluster is a group of networked computers that work together as one system, 
distributing tasks across nodes to use combined processing and memory for better 
performance, scalability, and reliability.
-> Parallelize work across multiple machines to do more in less time.

Advanatges of cluster computing
1. High Availability
2. Scalability
3. Performance
4. Cost-effective

Types
1. Highly available or fail-over
2. Load balancing
3. High-performance computing


Configurations
Commonsly used HA (high availability) configurations:

1. Active-Active
-> Made up of at least 2 nodes, both actively running same type of service simultaneously
-> Main purpose: to achieve load balancing

2. Active-Passive
-> Made up of at least 2 nodes, not all nodes are going to be active
-> In case of 2 nodes: if the first node is already active, then the second node must be passive
or on standby.


Load balancing vs Clustering
Clustering = coordinated teamwork.
Load balancing = smart traffic distribution.

Clustering: Servers know about each other and work together as one system for 
redundancy and high availability.
Load Balancing: Servers are independent; a load balancer simply distributes requests among them.

Both can be used together, but load balancing also works with standalone servers 
serving the same application.


Challenges of Clustering
More machines = more coordination and management overhead.
Clustering increases operational complexity—software must be installed and maintained on every node, 
heterogeneous nodes complicate management, resource usage and logs must be monitored centrally, 
and shared or distributed storage requires careful coordination to avoid conflicts and stay in sync.


Examples
1. Containers (e.g. Kubernetes, Amazon ECS)
2. Databases (e.g. Cassandra, MongoDB)
3. Cache (e.g. Redis)
