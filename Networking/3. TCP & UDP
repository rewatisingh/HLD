TCP
-> Transmission Control Protocol
-> Connection oriented (once connection is established, data can trasnmit in both the directions)
-> In-built systems to check for errors and to guarantee that the data will be delivered in the order it was sent
-> Preferred for transferring information like still images, data files, and web pages
-> Reliable but feedback mechanisms result in a larger overhead    


UDP
-> User Datagram Protocol
-> Connectionless internet protocol 
-> Error checking and recovery services are not required 
-> No overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, or terminating a connection
-> Data is continuously sent to the recipient, whether or not they receive it
-> Preferred for real-time communications like broadcast or multicast network transmission

Differences between TCP and UDP
Fetaure: Connection
TCP - Requires an established connection
UDP - Connectionless protocol

Fetaure: Guaranteed delivery	
TCP - Can guarantee delivery of data
UDP - Cannot guarantee delivery of data

Fetaure: Re-transmission
TCP - 	Re-transmission of lost packets is possible
UDP - No re-transmission of lost packets

Fetaure: Speed
TCP - Slower than UDP
UDP - Faster than TCP

Fetaure: Broadcasting
TCP - Does not support broadcasting
UDP - Supports broadcasting

Use Cases
TCP - HTTPS, HTTP, SMTP, POP, FTP, etc
UDP - Video streaming, DNS, VoIP, etc

Both are part of transport layer
