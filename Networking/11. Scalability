Scalability
-> It is the measure of how well a system responds to changes by adding or removing 
resources to meet demands.


Vertical scaling
-> Vertical scaling (also known as scaling up) expands a system's scalability by adding more power 
to an existing machine. 
-> Vertical scaling refers to improving an application's capability via increasing hardware capacity.

Advantages
    1. Simple to implement
    2. Easier to manage
    3. Data consistent
Disadvantages
    1. Risk of high downtime
    2. Harder to upgrade
    3. Can be a single point of failure


Horizontal scaling
-> Horizontal scaling (also known as scaling out) expands a system's scale by adding more machines. 
-> It improves the performance of the server by adding more instances to the existing pool of servers, 
allowing the load to be distributed more evenly.

Advantages
    1. Increased redundancy
    2. Better fault tolerance
    3. Flexible and efficient
    4. Easier to upgrade
Disadvantages
    1. Increased complexity
    2. Data inconsistency
    3. Increased load on downstream services
