Availability
-> Availability is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function 
in a specific period. 
-> It is a simple measure of the percentage of time that a system, service, or machine 
remains operational under normal conditions.


Availability vs Reliability
Reliability means the system works correctly without failure, 
and a reliable system is naturally available. 

Availability means the system is accessible when needed, even if failures occur. 

High reliability leads to high availability, but a system can be highly available through 
redundancy and failover while still being unreliable internally.


High Availability vs Fault Tolerance
Both aim for high uptime, but differ in approach. 

Fault tolerance ensures zero service interruption by using full hardware redundancy, 
allowing an immediate takeover if a component fails, but at a much higher cost. 

High availability allows minimal downtime by recovering quickly from failures, 
making it more cost-effective but not completely interruption-free.
