CDN - Content Delivery Network
-> A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers 
that work together to provide fast delivery of internet content. 
-> Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN.


Why use a CDN?
-> A CDN delivers content from servers closest to users, improving speed, availability, 
and security while reducing load and bandwidth costs on the origin servers.
-> CDN increases content availability and redundancy while reducing bandwidth costs 
and improving security. 
-> Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance as users receive content 
from data centers close to them and our servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills.


How does a CDN work?
CDN has an origin server that stores the original content and multiple geographically distributed 
edge servers that cache this content closer to users. 
Each edge location contains caching servers that deliver static assets to nearby visitors. 
Once content is cached, future requests from that region are served from the edge 
instead of the origin, reducing latency and origin load.

For example, if a website is hosted in the USA and a user in the UK accesses it, 
the content is served from a nearby edge location such as London rather than the US origin, 
resulting in faster response times and better scalability.


Types of CDN

1. Push CDNs
-> A Push CDN requires content to be manually uploaded to the CDN whenever it changes, 
with URLs rewritten to point to the CDN. 
-> Content is stored only when new or updated, reducing network traffic but using more storage. 
-> This approach works best for low-traffic sites or content that rarely changes, 
since assets are uploaded once and not repeatedly fetched.

2. Pull CDNs
-> A Pull CDN fetches content automatically from the origin server when a user first requests it 
and caches it for future requests. 
-> This requires less maintenance because caching happens on demand. 
-> Pull CDNs are better suited for high-traffic sites, as only frequently accessed content 
stays cached and traffic is distributed efficiently.


Disadvantages
1. Extra charges: 
It can be expensive to use a CDN, especially for high-traffic services.

2. Restrictions: 
Some organizations and countries have blocked the domains or IP addresses of popular CDNs.

3. Location: 
If most of our audience is located in a country where the CDN has no servers, 
the data on our website may have to travel further than without using any CDN.


Examples
1. Amazon CloudFront
2. Google Cloud CDN
3. Cloudflare CDN
4. Fastly
