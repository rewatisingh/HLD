OSI Model
-> Universal language for computer networking 
-> Allows us to take a very complex communications process apart and evaluate its components

7 Layers 
Top to bottom
7. Application Layer
-> Directly interacts with users
-> Protocols include HTTP and SMTP
-> Responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user

6. Presentation Layer
-> Also called Translation Layer
-> Data from Application Layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network
-> Translation, Encryption/Decryption, and compression

5. Session Layer
-> Responsible for opening and closing communication between two devices
-> Ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources
-> Time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session

4. Transport Layer
-> Responsible for end to end communication between two devices
-> Takes data from Session Layer, breaks it into chunks called Segments and sends it to Network Layer
-> Also responsible for reassembling segments on the receiving device into data the session layer can consume

3. Network Layer
-> Facilitates data transfer between two different networks
-> Breaks up segments from transport layer into smaller units called packets on sender's device and reassembles these packets on the receiver's device
-> Also finds best physical path for the data to reach its destination - called Routing
-> If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary

2. Data Link Layer
-> Similar to Network Layer except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the same network
-> Takes packets from Network Layers and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames

1. Physical Layer
-> Includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches
-> Data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s
-> Physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices
