Load Balancing 
-> Distributes incoming traffic across multiple resources ensuring high availability 
and reliability by sending requests only to resources that are online

Load Balancer
-> It distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers so no single server is overloaded, 
improving performance, scalability, and fault tolerance by routing requests only to healthy servers.


Workload distribution
1. Host-Based: Distributes requests based on the requested hostname
2. Path-Based: Using the entire URL to distribute requests as opposed to just the hostname
3. Content-based: Inspects the message content of a request (Eg: distribution based on the value of a parameter)


Layers
1. Network layer
-> Layer 4
-> Routing based on networking information such as IP addresses
-> No Content-Based routing
-> Can operate at high speed

2. Application layer
-> Layer 7
-> Load Balancers can read requests and perform Content-Based routing
-> Allows the management of load based on a full understanding of traffic


Type of Load Balancers
1. Software
-> Easier to deploy than hardware versions
-> More cost-effective and flexible
-> Flexibility of configuring the load balancer to our environment's specific needs

2. Hardware
-> Relies on physical, on-premises hardware to distribute application and network traffic
-> Can handle a large volume of traffic but often carry a hefty price tag and are fairly limited 
in terms of flexibility

3. DNS 
-> Practice of configuring a domain in the Domain Name System (DNS) such that client requests 
to the domain are distributed across a group of server machines
-> DNS does not check for server and network outages, or errors
-> It always returns the same set of IP addresses for a domain even if servers are down or inaccessible.


Routing Algorithms
1. Round-robin
-> Requests are distributed to application servers in rotation.

2. Weighted Round-robin
-> Builds on the simple Round-robin technique to account for differing server characteristics 
such as compute and traffic handling capacity using weights that can be assigned via DNS records by the administrator.

3. Least Connections
-> A new request is sent to the server with the fewest current connections to clients. 
-> The relative computing capacity of each server is factored into determining 
-> which one has the least connections.

4. Least Response Time
Sends requests to the server selected by a formula that combines the fastest response time and 
fewest active connections.

5. Least Bandwidth
-> This method measures traffic in megabits per second (Mbps), sending client requests to 
the server with the least Mbps of traffic.

6. Hashing
-> Distributes requests based on a key we define, such as the client IP address or the request URL.
