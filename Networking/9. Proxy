Proxy
-> A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers, 
forwarding client requests to origin servers. 
-> Used to filter, log, secure, and modify requests, such as adding or removing headers, 
handling encryption/decryption, or compressing data before forwarding.


Types
1. Forward proxy
-> A forward proxy sits between client machines and the internet, 
intercepting client requests and forwarding them to external servers on the clients’ behalf, 
acting as a middleman between users and web services.
-> Also called proxy, proxy server, or web proxy
Advanatges of forward proxy
    1. Block access to certain content
    2. Allows access to geo-restricted content
    3. Provides anonymity
    4. Avoid other browsing restrictions

2. Reverse proxy
-> A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers, 
intercepting requests from clients. 
-> When clients send requests to the origin server of a website, those requests are intercepted 
by the reverse proxy server.
Advanatges of reverse proxy
    1. Improved security
    2. Caching
    3. SSL encryption
    4. Load balancing
    5. Scalability and flexibility


A forward proxy sits in front of clients and hides them from origin servers, 
A reverse proxy sits in front of origin servers and hides them from clients, 
ensuring clients never communicate directly with the backend servers.


Load balancer vs Reverse Proxy
A load balancer is primarily used when multiple backend servers exist and distributes traffic 
among them to improve scalability and availability. 
A reverse proxy sits in front of one or more servers and can be useful even with a single backend, 
handling concerns like security, caching, and request routing. 

While a reverse proxy can perform load balancing, 
a load balancer does not provide the broader capabilities of a reverse proxy.


Examples
1. Nginx
2. HAProxy
3. Traefik
4. Envoy
